This is the program for slicing on 3D printer.
We have many applications working on slicing from open-source, but most of them are not good enough to do the real work.
Some just take too much time on computing, some are not able to handle with models which are too big.
This program has been optimized on many parts. Compared with MatterControl, which is the well known open-source software working on 3D printer, this program can do the same job 30 times faster and won't crash.

This program can handle with both ASCII and binary STL files.

Even it can work faster and more stable, there is still some work need to do.
We don't implement the support matter function in it, which itself can be another project.
And we don't have the User Interface for it.

User have to built it up by Makefile in Linux, run the executable file with the stl file as the input parameter, or it will use the default input file.
And the input file has to be stored in "stl_files/", and the gcode file will be output into "gcode_files/".
